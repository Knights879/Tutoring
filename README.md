# Work in Progress

I will be updating this periodically with things that I come up with in my tutoring sessions, or things that I think are important and should be mentioned.

## Languages

## Tips

### Learning a New Language

Whenever you are learning a new language, **always** find the official language specification/standard library documentation and bookmark it so that you can reference it as you learn. For larger languages like Java and Python, it is nice to have both, so that you know the syntax/behavior of the language as well as what the standard libraries have to offer. While the language specification will often include the standard library, I prefer to find a place that is dedicated to listing the library out in a more readable manner.

- `C`* - [Specification](https://www.iso-9899.info/wiki/The_Standard)** / [Library](https://cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/)
- `C++`* - [Specification](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/standards)** / [Library](https://cplusplus.com/reference/)
- `Java` - [Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/index.html)** / [Library](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html)
- `JavaScript (ECMAScript)` - [Specification](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)** / [Library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects)
- `Python` - [Specification](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-index) / [Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index)
- `Scheme` - [Specification/Library](https://standards.scheme.org/)

*Note: For some reason the ISO wants to make you pay like $200 for the official specification, but versions of them are available.

**Note: These are links that have links to the different versions of the language. So just click on the PDF/HTML link of the version you want.
